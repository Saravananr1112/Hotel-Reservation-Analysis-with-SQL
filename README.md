# Hotel-Reservation-Analysis-with-SQL

### About
The hotel industry relies on data to make informed decisions and provide a better guest experience. In this internship, you will work with a hotel reservation dataset to gain insights into guest preferences, booking trends, and other key factors that impact the hotel's operations. You will use SQL to query and analyze the data, as well as answer specific questions about the dataset.

### Project Objectives
1. What is the total number of reservations in the dataset?
2. Which meal plan is the most popular among guests?
3. What is the average price per room for reservations involving children?
4. How many reservations were made for the year 20XX (replace XX with the desired year)?
5. What is the most commonly booked room type?
6. How many reservations fall on a weekend (no_of_weekend_nights > 0)?
7. What is the highest and lowest lead time for reservations?
8. What is the most common market segment type for reservations?
9. How many reservations have a booking status of "Confirmed"?
10. What is the total number of adults and children across all reservations?
11. What is the average number of weekend nights for reservations involving children?
12. How many reservations were made in each month of the year?
13. What is the average number of nights (both weekend and weekday) spent by guests for each room type?
14. For reservations involving children, what is the most common room type, and what is the average price for that room type?
15. Find the market segment type that generates the highest average price per room.

### Import the Hotel Reservation Database
For this task, I have to download the hotel reservation.csv file, which is the csv file that contains related data.

### Analyse
I reformatted the date format for query optimization.
